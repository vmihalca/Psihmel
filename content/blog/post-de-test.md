**One** challenge for frontend projects is handling authentication. OAuth2 is a widely accepted standard used by many services and APIs, but the OAuth authentication process requires a server to send a signed request to the OAuth server, signed with a secret that you can never expose to the client side of your app.  Netlify solves this problem by providing an integrated service that will sign the OAuth requests for you and give back an access token ready to use.One challenge for frontend projects is handling authentication.
